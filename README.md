# Terms of Service — Odrat

## Effective date: 2025-11-05

Important: Odrat is for educational, research, and authorized testing purposes only.
Do NOT use it to damage or access systems you do not own or have explicit written permission to test.

1. Introduction

Welcome to Odrat. By downloading, installing, running, or otherwise using Odrat (the “Software”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Software.

2. Safety notice — prohibition of malicious use

Odrat must not be used to attack, disrupt, delete, or otherwise harm any system, network, online service, or account unless you are the owner of the target system or you have written, verifiable authorization from the owner for the specific actions you will perform. Any malicious use is strictly prohibited and may be a criminal offense. The developer does not condone or support illegal activity and will cooperate with law enforcement.

3. Authorized use & written permission requirement

You may only use Odrat for:

(a) systems you own and control; or

(b) systems where you have explicit written authorization from the owner for the exact testing you will perform.

You must retain records of such authorization and provide them upon lawful request.

4. License grant & restrictions

Subject to these Terms, the developer grants a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software for permitted purposes. You must not:

Use Odrat to perform unauthorized access, destruction, or denial-of-service attacks.

Distribute, sell, or sublicense the Software for malicious use.

Remove or tamper with copyright or proprietary notices.

5. Accounts & third-party services

If Odrat integrates with third-party services (e.g., Discord API), you must follow those services’ Terms. You are responsible for all activity under your accounts/credentials.

6. Safety, testing environment & backups

Before running Odrat on any system, ensure backups and safeguards exist. Do not run destructive tests in production unless explicitly authorized by the system owner.

7. Responsible disclosure

If you discover a vulnerability while testing under authorization, follow responsible disclosure: notify the affected party and the Odrat maintainer, and avoid public disclosure until remediated.

8. Termination

The developer may suspend or terminate your license for breaches. Termination does not limit other legal remedies.

9. Disclaimer of warranties

Odrat is provided “AS IS”. To the maximum extent allowed by law, there are no warranties — express or implied.

10. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted, the developer will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from use of Odrat.

11. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer and contributors from claims or damages arising from your misuse or breach of these Terms.

12. Cooperation with law enforcement

The developer will cooperate with lawful requests from authorities and may disclose account or usage information.

13. Governing law & jurisdiction

These Terms are governed by the laws of Greece. Disputes will be resolved in the competent courts of Greece.

14. Changes to Terms

The developer may update the Terms; continued use after notice is acceptance.
